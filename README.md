# EQX-Test-Visual-Samples

This is a repo for collecting typographic samples that may be offered in the initial EQX release.

This repo allows people to see what's being made before EQX releases, contribute if they want to, or offer suggestions.

This repo doesn't pair the sample with material that makes them more useful such as 
	
	1) A Test Question
	
	2) Test context or explanation
	
	3) Test visual references to compare the sample

That's what EQX does - along with letting you track results and collect comments/feedback.
